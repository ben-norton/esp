This directory serves as a place to aggregate resources related to georeferencing for paleobiology specimens. More to come on how to contribute. For now, please send an email to Erica Krimmel (ekrimmel@fsu.edu) with your contributions.

### Videos

<!--Add a video link by copying the code in the line that begins with "include" onto
a new line. Then...

(1) Replace "videoid" with the video id of your video, e.g. if the link to your video
is "https://player.vimeo.com/video/408990525" then the video id is "408990525"

(2) Make sure the source is correct; you may only link videos available on
"vimeo" or "youtube" {% include iframe.html videoid = "408990525" source = "vimeo" %}-->

### Links to external resources

<!-- Add a new link to an external resource by copying the code in the line
below onto a new line and replacing "title" with your desired title and "url" with the link.- [title](url) -->
