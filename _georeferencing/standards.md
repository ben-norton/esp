- [Georeferencing Best Practices](https://doi.org/10.15468/doc-gg7h-s853), Chapman & Wieczorek 2020. This document deals with the theoretical aspects (how to, and why, sources of uncertainty) of spatially enabling information about the location of biodiversity-related phenomena, including special consideration for ecological marine and palaeontological data. It also covers approaches to large-scale and collaborative georeferencing projects.

- Georeferencing Quick Reference Guide, Zermoglio et al. 2020 (forthcoming). This document accompanies _Georeferencing Best Practices_ and provides a practical how-to guide for putting the theory of the point-radius georeferencing method into practice.

- [Georeferencing Calculator](http://georeferencing.org/georefcalculator/gc.htm), Wieczorek & Wieczorek 2020. This is a browser-based javascript application that aids in georeferencing descriptive localities and provides methods to help obtain geographic coordinates and uncertainties for locations.
