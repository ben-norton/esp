- [Georeferencing Best Practices](https://tinyurl.com/y7puwt7r), Chapman & Wieczorek 2020. This document deals with the theoretical aspects (how to, and why, sources of uncertainty) of spatially enabling information about the location of biodiversity-related phenomena, including special consideration for ecological marine and paleontological data. It also covers approaches to large-scale and collaborative georeferencing projects. See the "Georeferencing Documentation" video below for a comparison of this document with others linked in this section.

- [Georeferencing Quick Reference Guide](https://tinyurl.com/ydxckkxs), Zermoglio et al. 2020. This document accompanies _Georeferencing Best Practices_ and provides a practical how-to guide for putting the theory of the point-radius georeferencing method into practice. See the "Georeferencing Documentation" video below for a comparison of this document with others linked in this section.

- [Georeferencing Calculator](http://georeferencing.org/georefcalculator/gc.html), Wieczorek & Wieczorek 2020. This is a browser-based javascript application that accompanies the _Georeferencing Calculator Manual_ and aids in georeferencing descriptive localities by providing methods to help obtain geographic coordinates and uncertainties for locations.
