title:  "Georeferencing Standards"
---

Resources on this page are related to standards for georeferencing. To contribute a resource to this page, either upload files to the [georeferencing > standards directory]({{ site.github_path }}/_{{ page.collection }}/standards), or edit [this page]({{ site.github_path }}/_{{ page.collection }}/standards.md) to add links to external resources or videos.

### Documents

{% include document-list.html folder = "standards" label = page.collection %}

### Images

{% include image-gallery.html folder="standards" %}

### Videos

<!-- Add a video link by copying the code in the line that begins with "include" onto
a new line. Then...

(1) Replace "videoid" with the video id of your video, e.g. if the link to your video
is "https://player.vimeo.com/video/408990525" then the video id is "408990525"

(2) Make sure the source is correct; you may only link videos available on
"vimeo" or "youtube"

{% include iframe.html videoid = "408990525" source = "vimeo" %}
-->

{% include iframe.html videoid = "ssswKJjMUnE" source = "youtube" %}

### Links to external resources

<!-- Add a new link to an external resource by copying the code in the line
below onto a new line and replacing "title" with your desired title and "url" with the link.

- [Georeferencing Best Practices](https://doi.org/10.15468/doc-gg7h-s853), Chapman & Wieczorek 2020. This document deals with the theoretical aspects (how to, and why, sources of uncertainty) of spatially enabling information about the location of biodiversity-related phenomena, including special consideration for ecological marine and palaeontological data. It also covers approaches to large-scale and collaborative georeferencing projects.

- [Georeferencing Quick Reference Guide](https://doi.org/10.35035/e09p-h128), Zermoglio et al. 2020. This document accompanies _Georeferencing Best Practices_ and provides a practical how-to guide for putting the theory of the point-radius georeferencing method into practice.

- [Georeferencing Calculator](http://georeferencing.org/georefcalculator/gc.htm), Wieczorek & Wieczorek 2020. This is a browser-based javascript application that aids in georeferencing descriptive localities and provides methods to help obtain geographic coordinates and uncertainties for locations.
