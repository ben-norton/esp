Resources on this page are related to specific workflows and workflow tools, often specific to an institution or collection. To contribute a resource to this page, either upload files to the [georeferencing > workflows directory]({{ site.github_path }}/_{{ page.collection }}/workflows), or edit [this page]({{ site.github_path }}/_{{ page.collection }}/workflows.md) to add links to external resources or videos.

### Images

{% include image-gallery.html folder="workflows" label = page.collection %}

### Documents

{% include document-list.html folder = "workflows" label = page.collection %}

### Videos
<!-- Add a video link by copying the code in the line that begins with "include" onto
a new line. Then...

(1) Replace "videoid" with the video id of your video, e.g. if the link to your video
is "https://player.vimeo.com/video/408990525" then the video id is "408990525"

(2) Make sure the source is correct; you may only link videos available on
"vimeo" or "youtube"

{% include iframe.html videoid = "408990525" source = "vimeo" %}
-->

{% include iframe.html videoid = "408990525" source = "vimeo" %}
{% include iframe.html videoid = "408991069" source = "vimeo" %}
{% include iframe.html videoid = "408988862" source = "vimeo" %}
{% include iframe.html videoid = "408986914" source = "vimeo" %}
{% include iframe.html videoid = "409784937" source = "vimeo" %}
{% include iframe.html videoid = "409780588" source = "vimeo" %}
{% include iframe.html videoid = "409003066" source = "vimeo" %}
