Resources on this page are related to geospatial resources that may be useful for georeferencing. To contribute a resource to this page, either upload files to the [georeferencing > geospatial resources directory]({{ site.github_path }}/_{{ page.collection }}/geospatial-resources), or edit [this page]({{ site.github_path }}/_{{ page.collection }}/geospatial-resources.md) to add links to external resources or videos.

### Documents

{% include document-list.html folder = "geospatial-resources" label = page.collection %}

### Images

{% include image-gallery.html folder="geospatial-resources" %}

### Videos

<!-- Add a video link by copying the code in the line that begins with "include" onto
a new line. Then...

(1) Replace "videoid" with the video id of your video, e.g. if the link to your video
is "https://player.vimeo.com/video/408990525" then the video id is "408990525"

(2) Make sure the source is correct; you may only link videos available on
"vimeo" or "youtube"

{% include iframe.html videoid = "408990525" source = "vimeo" %}
-->

### Links to external resources

<!-- Add a new link to an external resource by copying the code in the line
below onto a new line and replacing "title" with your desired title and "url" with the link.
